Why "e4"?
---------

e4 is an *Embeddable 4th*, so e4 can be taken as an abbreviation for
that. Also, e4 is a nice convenient two letter name that doesn't seem to
be in use by any major software project currently. Also, :code:`1. e4`
is the first move in several of my favorite `chess openings`_.

Build Dependencies
------------------

Generating the amalgamated source file, and by extension building the
REPL, requires `amal.rb`_ (which itself requires Ruby). Additionally,
the REPL requires `libedit`_.

To generate the amalgamated source file or to build the REPL and/or
tests using the provided Makefile, a C compiler that recognizes flags
like :code:`-MMD` and :code:`-MP` for generating object dependencies is
necessary. GCC and Clang are both capable of this and the provided
Makefile has been verified to work correctly with either. If, for some
reason, you do not have access to either of those compilers but wish to
generate a bespoke e4 amalgamation, please refer to the Makefile for an
example of how amal.rb should be invoked.

The amalgamated source file generated by amal.rb (and made available via
official releases) has no dependencies beyond a C compiler supporting
the ISO C90 (aka ANSI C89) standard.
